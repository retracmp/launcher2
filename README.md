## Features

- Speedy Downloader that optimises storage using chunked files.
- WebSocket communication between backend and the launcher, which makes updates live & instant.
- Very customisable UI, with themes and lots of layout options.

## Coming in the future

- Overhauling the internal UI framework and outsourcing to an external package that will be hosted on npm.
  - _i need to use it for the retrac website so do not want to maintain two separate codebases doing the same thing_
